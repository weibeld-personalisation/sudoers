# Causes $HOME and '~' to keep pointing to the invoking user's home directory
# instead of the root user's home directory. This is has a lot of impact for 
# commands that use config files from $HOME such as Vim (~/.vimrc), Git
# (~/.gitconfig), and many more. For example, 'sudo vim' will use the same Vim
# configuration as when Vim is executed normally. Similarly, if an interactive
# root shell is started with 'sudo -s', this shell will use the normal user's
# ~/.bashrc file and thus all the normal user's configuration will be avilable.
